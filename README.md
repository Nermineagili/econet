#Decentralized Energy Trading App
This is a decentralized energy trading application built with Next.js, Node.js, Web3.js, and blockchain. The purpose of this application is to provide a platform for buying and selling renewable energy directly between consumers and producers, without the need for intermediaries.

Installation
Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
Install Node.js if you haven't already.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run npm install to install the dependencies.
Rename .env.example to .env and set your own values for the environment variables.
Run npm run dev to start the development server.
Usage
Once the development server is running, you can access the web application by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. You can create an account and then either buy or sell renewable energy.

The application uses the Ethereum blockchain to store and execute smart contracts for buying and selling energy. The smart contracts are written in Solidity and can be found in the contracts directory. Web3.js is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
